A simple shortcode to include SalesAutopilot forms into WordPress.

== Description ==

A simple shortcode to include SalesAutopilot forms into WordPress. This is a very useful plugin if your users don't have permission to embed javascript in the content or you just want to use a more simple way to embed the forms wherever you want.

**The shortcode:**

`[sa-form listid="THIS_IS_THE_LISTID" formid="THIS_IS_THE_FORMID"]`

Where listid is the SalesAutopilot's list ID and formid is the form's ID, that you want to display.

You can find these IDs in your SalesAutopilot admin area, when you select a form. Both IDs are at the bottom of that page.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `surbma-salesautopilot-shortcode` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the Surbma | SalesAutopilot Shortcode plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. That's it. Now you can use the shortcode. :)
